# Testing Strategy

Status: implementation specification, planning-only. The repository has no application code, package manifest, test runner, or CI as of 2026-10-10. Every test ID below is a planned obligation, not evidence: this document must never be cited as proof that a test exists or passes. Evidence exists only as executed command output and captured artifacts from the phase that implements the test. Requirement IDs (`FR-*`) are owned by [functional requirements](01-functional-requirements.md); behavioral contracts by [LangGraph design](03-langgraph-design.md), [domain model](04-domain-model.md), and [synthetic data design](05-synthetic-data-design.md).

## 1. Evidence Rules

- A requirement is accepted only when its listed test IDs were executed in the phase gate and their output reviewed; "looks fine" is not evidence.
- Tests added in later phases must not be back-dated. No phase may claim a test it did not run.
- Every test names the FR IDs it covers (traceability), and assertions are deterministic: fixed seeds, fixture AI, persisted fault overlays, exact expected status codes/reason codes/row counts.
- Fault tests must observe real processes and real PostgreSQL 17, never a mocked checkpointer.

## 2. Test Layers, Tools, and Environments

| Layer | Runner | Scope and rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | Vitest 5.0.3 | Pure domain/contract code: preference inheritance, date math, feasibility rules, pricing, schema validation, pricing/cost gates. No database, no network, no LLM. |
| Integration | Vitest + real PostgreSQL 17 | Real SQL migrations, real LangGraph PostgreSQL checkpointer, real `pg` connections, real worker driver functions. No provider/LLM network calls (fixture AI, simulated providers). Dedicated disposable test database/role via `TEST_DATABASE_URL`; never a production database; reset/truncate between tests; transactions where the test is not about isolation. |
| E2E | Playwright | Browser journeys against the locally started web app + worker with fixture AI. Desktop viewport 1280x800 and mobile 390x844. Worker/DB fault recipes are driven by the test harness (process signals, container/service restart), never by in-page commands. |
| Invariant/property | Shared harness over seeded scenario matrices | Re-runs invariant suites across variants, cities, dates (including DST boundaries), and AI modes; schema/index assertions against SQL. |
| Fault | Vitest integration + Playwright harness | Controlled worker process restart (SIGTERM/SIGKILL, new OS process), PostgreSQL restart at waiting and mid-operation, crash windows (kill between domain commit and checkpoint write), lease expiry. |

## 3. Commands and Environment (established by Phase 01, not yet present)

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm ci` | Reproducible install from the single committed lockfile |
| `docker compose up -d postgres` | Local PostgreSQL 17 (health-checked) |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply SQL migrations to the target database |
| `npm run checkpointer:setup` | One-time LangGraph checkpointer schema setup |
| `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` | Type and lint gates |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit suite (no services required) |
| `npm run test:integration` | Integration suite; requires PostgreSQL 17 at `TEST_DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright suite; requires installed browsers and the local stack in fixture mode |
| `npm run build` | Production build gate |
| `npm run dev` | Web + worker as tracked sibling processes for E2E and manual use |

Rules:integration/E2E uses disposable PostgreSQL17 with test fixtures, never production. CI order:typecheck -> lint -> unit -> integration -> build -> e2e. Fixture E2E makes no OpenRouter call. Phase gates in section14 require these commands from Phase01 onward.

## 4. Test ID Scheme and Traceability Rules

Prefixes: `T-UT-` unit, `T-IT-` integration, `T-E2E-` Playwright, `T-INV-` invariant/property, `T-FLT-` crash/driver fault, `T-REG-FEAS-` feasibility regressions. IDs are permanent; deleting a test retires its ID rather than reusing it. Each row below names the FR IDs it verifies; the inverse map lives in [functional requirements](01-functional-requirements.md).

## 5. Unit Suite

| ID | Assertion | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-UT-PRD-01 | Disclaimer strings render verbatim; every confirmation template includes both the permanent and per-confirmation disclaimer. | FR-PRD-2 |
| T-UT-PREF-01 | Welcome/preference schema round-trip and defaults: 1 adult, `two_nights`, `standard`, `moderate`, no overrides/counts/budget; bounds on name, date, adults (1..6). | FR-PREF-1 |
| T-UT-PREF-02 | Inherited vs explicit service level: `override ?? default`; explicit `standard` counts as override; clearing removes it; global change touches only inherited services; each meal is independent. | FR-PREF-3 |
| T-UT-PREF-03 | Variant date math: check-in `D-1`; checkout `D`/`D+1`; arrival `D-1`; late return `D` or `D+1`; DST-boundary dates; one-night only with a proven late-return schedule. | FR-PREF-2 |
| T-UT-PREF-04 | Pace helpers: guideline counts qualified by duration/travel/opening constraints; pace independent of interest categories; conflict detection (relaxed + six museums; seven short stops vs seven major museums). | FR-PREF-5, FR-PREF-7 |
| T-UT-PREF-05 | Relative cheaper search preserves the selected/confirmed offer's category even when the global effective preference changed afterwards; explicit `level` is the only category-change path; without a selection use effective category plus clarification or shown cap. | FR-PREF-6 |
| T-UT-PREF-06 | `minimumActivityCounts`: relative counts computed against current actual tags before storing; set/clear via `set_activity_requirement`; 1..7 bounds; requirement survives planning attempts. | FR-PREF-7 |
| T-UT-FEAS-01 | Stage A rule table: same airport/catchment; < 350 km warning; ground-preferred computation; 350..3500 km standard eligibility; connection and door-to-door bounds; `UNDETERMINED` cases; policy version inside the approval. | FR-FEAS-1, FR-FEAS-2 |
| T-UT-FEAS-02 | Fingerprint sensitivity: every bound route input changes the hash; unrelated fields do not; a persisted approval with a mismatched fingerprint is rejected by both generator and booking comparison helpers. | FR-FEAS-7, FR-FEAS-8 |
| T-UT-FEAS-03 | Stage B pure validator: duration formula bounds (>= 35 min), 75..240-minute connections, <= 1 stop, DST gap/fold rejection, typed reason codes, no fabricated repairs. | FR-FEAS-9, FR-DATA-4 |
| T-UT-ITIN-01 | Deterministic itinerary validator taxonomy: overlap, opening hours, transfer gap, airport buffer, insufficient sightseeing, missing meal/break, excessive walking, reservation conflict, budget exceeded, unmet `minimumActivityCounts`; errors block, warnings explained; metrics and fingerprint present. | FR-ITIN-2 |
| T-UT-ITIN-02 | Program assembly helpers: pace structure, meal duration templates, deterministic cost/route resolution; a review proposal cannot bypass deterministic rejection. | FR-ITIN-4, FR-ITIN-1 |
| T-UT-BOOK-01 | Reservation reference format/collision resistance; lifecycle transitions (proposed/confirmed/superseded/cancelled) valid and invalid table. | FR-PRD-3, FR-BOOK-5 |
| T-UT-DATA-01 | Determinism: same seed/key/versions produce identical domain content hashes; separate streams per domain and per meal; extension preserves prior IDs/hashes; `generatedAt` excluded from payload determinism. | FR-DATA-1, FR-DATA-2 |
| T-UT-DATA-02 | Pricing: level/city/season/weekend/nights factors, per-date room-night computation, party totals, single rounding boundary, meaningful category separation, cuisine factor bounds. | FR-DATA-3, FR-DATA-5 |
| T-UT-DATA-03 | Location and provenance: safe-anchor/envelope rejection, approximate labels, landmark reference vs synthetic labels, no navigation claims. | FR-DATA-6, FR-DATA-7 |
| T-UT-REF-01 | Admission manifest: EU + listed countries, XK extension documented, TR/RU reviewed allowlist only, GE/AM/AZ/KZ excluded, island exceptions; no continent-only filtering. | FR-REF-1, FR-REF-4 |
| T-UT-REF-02 | City search and coverage flags; `cities15000` limitation reported; no invented cities. | FR-REF-1 |
| T-UT-REF-03 | Airport eligibility and autocomplete: closed/heliport/seaplane/unknown codes rejected; PRG default is demo-only. | FR-REF-2 |
| T-UT-REF-04 | Catchment resolution: 150 km radius, <= 3 airports, transfer <= 120 min, metro preference, structured limitation when none. | FR-REF-3 |
| T-UT-REF-05 | Import manifests complete (URL, revision/date, SHA-256, license, attribution, transform, counts, rejected report); license texts committed; no runtime downloads. | FR-REF-5 |
| T-UT-REF-06 | Zone evidence: import-time `geo-tz` resolution plus reviewed overrides with reasons; unknown/ambiguous/`Etc/GMT` results block passenger eligibility until reviewed. | FR-REF-6 |
| T-UT-RTE-01 | Routing estimates: deterministic per mode (path factor, speed, uncertainty allowance), `simulated: true`, straight-line never labeled road distance, no polyline. | FR-DATA-8 |
| T-UT-AI-01 | Structured output validation: strict unions; unknown keys rejected; <= 4 commands; conflicting writes and `preserve` conflicts rejected; exactly one repair attempt (2 calls total); confirmation/approval actions are decision-only, never commands. | FR-AI-2, FR-BOOK-6 |
| T-UT-AI-02 | Role profile validation; unknown model capability/pricing rejected before any call (fail closed); 40-call/USD 1.00 defaults configurable; worst-case cost reservation math; fixture label present. | FR-AI-1, FR-AI-4 |
| T-UT-OPS-01 | Startup config validation with actionable errors; graph wiring constructs the PostgreSQL checkpointer and never a memory saver; client bundle scan contains no secrets, `pg`, or LangGraph server imports. | FR-OPS-3, FR-SEC-3 |

## 6. Integration Suite (real PostgreSQL 17)

### 6.1 Invocation contract (exact cases)

| ID | Assertion | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-IT-INV-01 | New thread: plain validated input runs from `START`. | FR-GRAPH-3 |
| T-IT-INV-02 | Completed thread (`END`) + new command: plain new-operation input begins again at `START` with persisted state; `Command({update})` is never used; per-operation counters/scope reset through a serial-node `Overwrite` (old reducer scopes pruned or replaced, never cleared from a parallel worker). | FR-GRAPH-3, FR-GRAPH-10 |
| T-IT-INV-03 | Waiting thread with the exact pending decision: `Command({resume})` carries the trusted new operation envelope, updates serial operation identity/revision/counters, and resumes the exact interrupt without duplicated side effects. Public `modify`/operation-identity injection is rejected; surfaced interrupt ID matches the persisted binding. | FR-GRAPH-2/3 |
| T-IT-INV-04 | Crashed invocation with unfinished tasks and no unanswered interrupt: `null` reruns only unfinished tasks; completed siblings' pending writes are retained and not re-executed. | FR-GRAPH-3/6/8 |
| T-IT-INV-05 | `null` on a completed thread is a no-op: final state returned, no writes, events, or reservations created. | FR-GRAPH-3 |
| T-IT-INV-06 | Resume without a matching pending interrupt (stale, resolved, wrong kind, foreign thread): typed conflict, graph not invoked, no state change. | FR-GRAPH-2/3, FR-SEC-4 |
| T-IT-INV-07 | Worker crash before the first invoke: the original persisted input runs exactly once under the same operation effect keys. | FR-GRAPH-6 |
| T-IT-INV-08 | Accepted resume/modification crashes before its answer is checkpointed: recovery replays the original persisted envelope, even if its decision/effect already committed; new requests to a resolved decision remain rejected. Operation identity stays current and limits do not reset on recovery. | FR-GRAPH-3/6 |
| T-IT-INV-09 | Ordinary new command on an unfinished failed checkpoint gets `RECOVERY_REQUIRED`, not acceptance/ignored input. Owner technical retry requeues the same operation/input/effect scope without changing revision; duplicate control key reuses the result and a new explicit recovery round has at most 3 automatic claims. | FR-GRAPH-3/6, FR-GRAPH-5 |

### 6.2 Parallelism, reducers, retries

| ID | Assertion | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-IT-RED-01 | Keyed reducer map `researchRunId:domain`: unique keys merge; an equal key replaces only with the identical idempotent result; conflicting same-key results are rejected; result ordering is not meaningful; the join verifies every scheduled key and retains prior domains whose fingerprints still match. | FR-GRAPH-7 |
| T-IT-RED-02 | Zero affected domains routes directly to the next serial node (no dangling fan-in, no suspension); each node uses exactly one routing mechanism (static edge or `Command.goto`, never both). | FR-GRAPH-7 |
| T-IT-RET-01 | Scenario D: a transient hotel provider failure leaves breakfast/lunch/dinner/attractions/events succeeded; the automatic retry sends only `hotel`; total attempts for hotel <= 2; sibling artifact content hashes unchanged. | FR-GRAPH-8, FR-DEMO-2 |
| T-IT-RET-02 | An unexpected abort in one parallel branch keeps completed pending writes; `null` recovery reruns only unfinished tasks; no sibling artifact is regenerated. | FR-GRAPH-8 |

### 6.3 Bookings, ledger, crash windows of the effect model

| ID | Assertion | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-IT-BOOK-01 | Replacement supersedes the old confirmed row and confirms the new one in one transaction; exactly one active reservation per `(trip, service)`; old reservation active before confirmation. | FR-BOOK-2, FR-BOOK-5 |
| T-IT-BOOK-02 | Duplicate same request key (sequential and concurrent): one stored result/reservation; same key with a different payload rejected; replay returns the stored result. | FR-BOOK-3 |
| T-IT-BOOK-03 | Different request key for the same offer returns the existing active reservation; still exactly one active row. | FR-BOOK-3 |
| T-IT-BOOK-04 | Wrong offer (not in allowed IDs/snapshot), wrong trip (foreign ownership), wrong source (stale fingerprint), wrong decision (kind/resolved/foreign thread), wrong revision: typed conflict, no reservation row, no side effect. | FR-BOOK-4, FR-SEC-2/4 |
| T-IT-BOOK-05 | Pre-commit rollback: an injected failure inside the confirmation transaction leaves no reservation and no effect result; retry yields exactly one reservation. | FR-BOOK-1 |
| T-IT-BOOK-06 | Replacement only through a confirmed decision: direct commands or model output cannot confirm; route-change cancellation/supersede requires the explicit impact confirmation transaction. | FR-PREF-4, FR-BOOK-5/6 |

### 6.4 Worker faults, restarts, driver recovery

| ID | Assertion | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-IT-FLT-01 | Commit-before-checkpoint crash: domain effect committed, checkpoint write fails; recovery replays the node and reads the effect ledger `(operation_id, node_name, effect_scope)` returning the stored result; still one reservation; the failure is not converted into fabricated success. | FR-GRAPH-6 |
| T-IT-FLT-02 | Checkpoint written, completion event missing: recovery inspects the checkpoint and repairs the read projection/event ledger without booking again. | FR-GRAPH-6, FR-UI-4 |
| T-IT-FLT-03 | SIGKILL mid-parallel superstep: completed siblings' pending writes survive; recovery with `null` resumes only unfinished tasks. | FR-GRAPH-8 |
| T-IT-FLT-04 | SIGKILL while an unanswered interrupt is pending: the waiting projection is restored from the descriptor plus checkpoint; no invented resume answer. | FR-GRAPH-2/3 |
| T-IT-FLT-05 | Controlled worker process restart (new OS process, SIGTERM/SIGKILL variants) mid-operation and at an interrupt: the same trip thread recovers from PostgreSQL checkpoints; the test asserts the checkpointer is `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` (no memory saver can pass it). | FR-GRAPH-3/6 |
| T-IT-FLT-06 | PostgreSQL restart fault at a waiting state and mid-operation: after service restart the worker reconnects, lease expiry/renewal works, operation and thread recover, reservation/effect alignment holds. | FR-GRAPH-6 |
| T-IT-FLT-07 | Lease expiry and fencing: stale domain writes and official-saver `put`/`putWrites` are rejected after fencing-token rotation. The checkpoint-write gate lets admitted writes finish before rotation, uses a non-locking ownership read and separate bounded pool, and cannot deadlock with claiming; a lost trip lock aborts local work. | FR-GRAPH-4 |

### 6.5 Bounds, concurrency, selective replanning, cost, misc

| ID | Assertion | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-IT-LIM-01 | 3 total planning attempts (not 3 extra retries); the 4th is blocked into a recovery/clarification decision; the recursion guard (limit 100) is a typed safety failure, never a silent success or infinite loop. | FR-ITIN-3, FR-GRAPH-6 |
| T-IT-LIM-02 | 2 total provider attempts per affected domain per operation; retries send only failed domains. | FR-GRAPH-8 |
| T-IT-LIM-03 | 2 total LLM attempts including one repair, owned by the AI adapter; no graph retry layer stacked on the same call. | FR-AI-2 |
| T-IT-LIM-04 | 3 automatic driver claims per recovery round, then explicit technical retry only. Total claim/round counts stay monotonic; same-operation recovery does not reset graph/provider/AI budgets; a new business run after `END` gets its own scope. | FR-GRAPH-3/6 |
| T-IT-CONC-01 | Scenario M with two actual, independently opened database connections (not a shared pool client): concurrent duplicate confirmation produces one reservation and one stored result. | FR-BOOK-3 |
| T-IT-CONC-02 | Scenario N with two actual connections: two modifications at the same revision produce one deterministic winner; the loser receives `409 STALE_REVISION` or `409 OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS`; no mixed partial state; the winner is applied fully. | FR-GRAPH-4/5 |
| T-IT-REPL-01 | Selective replanning: a dinner-only override reruns neither breakfast nor lunch; a hotel search preserves flights and meals; a pace change preserves flight/hotel/confirmed-meal IDs; preserved domain content hashes and reservation IDs are unchanged. | FR-PREF-3/5, FR-GRAPH-9, FR-BOOK-8 |
| T-IT-COST-01 | Per-trip cost ledger: worst-case reservation before each billable call; attempted calls counted including retries; estimated vs actual cost recorded; over-limit attempts rejected with a typed failure. | FR-AI-4 |
| T-IT-COST-02 | Unknown pricing or model capability rejects the call before it happens (fail closed); no ledger row is written as if a price were known. | FR-AI-4 |
| T-IT-COST-03 | 40-call/USD1 trip limits hold across chat/resumes and new provider-retry commands; technical recovery retains the same operation. Fixture/live labels stay explicit and modes are not mixed. | FR-AI-4/5 |
| T-IT-COST-04 | Request fee reserved per attempt; all peak/time/token-threshold override maxima covered; base-only ceiling refused before transport. max_price includes prompt/completion/request and matched endpoint variants; ambiguous charges fail closed. | FR-AI-4, FR-SEC-2 |
| T-IT-DATA-01 | Snapshot persistence: domain content hashes identical across worker restarts and retries and independent of AI mode; extension appends a snapshot version preserving prior IDs; old reservations keep their original snapshot refs; trip date/variant round-trips. | FR-DATA-1/2, FR-PREF-2 |
| T-IT-AI-01 | Intent end-to-end: persisted intent -> validated commands -> deterministic application; `preserve` conflicts rejected; clarification options bind to current inputs; prompt-injection text cannot produce executable operations or booking mutations. | FR-AI-2/3/6, FR-SEC-5 |
| T-IT-OPS-01 | Migrations and checkpointer setup are explicit one-shot steps; readiness checks DB/migrations/checkpointer/worker heartbeat; session, CSRF, rate-limit, and ownership checks behave per contract; operation statuses use accepted/waiting/succeeded/failed. | FR-OPS-2/3, FR-SEC-1/3 |
| T-IT-OPS-02 | Duplicate complete trip-creation requests from two connections return one trip/initial operation; changed payload under the same session/key is rejected. Ordinary session renewals in two tabs preserve token/ownership and stable CSRF; expired sessions and open SSE cannot keep reading. | FR-OPS-2, FR-GRAPH-5, FR-SEC-1/4 |

Additional mandatory itinerary cases: nullable dinner only with a deterministic no-slot result (never dropping a booked dinner), fixed meal duration surviving pace changes, explicit numeric requirement retained inside an unexecuted clarification, and unrelated snapshot extension preserving flight-domain approvals despite a new global snapshot version.

## 7. End-to-End Suite (Playwright, fixture AI)

| ID | Journey and assertion | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-E2E-01 | Full one-night journey for each of Rome, Paris, Barcelona, with PRG demo default: welcome -> destination -> flights -> hotel -> meals/program -> itinerary review -> summary; timeline, map/fallback, costs, refs, disclaimers visible. | FR-PREF-1, FR-ITIN-1, FR-BOOK-1, FR-UI-6 |
| T-E2E-02 | Full two-night journey for each curated city, an alternate supported origin (AMS), and a non-curated city (Lisbon): search/coverage labels work; generic activities are explicitly limited/synthetic, not invented factual landmarks. | FR-REF-1/2, FR-PREF-2 |
| T-E2E-03 | Confirmation views show both disclaimer strings, `DEMO-*` reference formats, and demo/simulated labels on every offer and reservation. | FR-PRD-2/3, FR-DATA-7 |
| T-E2E-04 | Scenario H: "cheaper hotel, keep flights" -> same-category cheaper proposal; flights, meals, activity hashes, and booking IDs unchanged; old hotel active until the replacement is explicitly confirmed. | FR-PREF-4/6, FR-GRAPH-9 |
| T-E2E-05 | Scenario I: global Luxury, breakfast overridden to Budget; dinner-only change refreshes dinner only; inherited vs explicit indicators; hotel/lunch untouched. | FR-PREF-3 |
| T-E2E-06 | Scenarios G/J: Intensive -> Relaxed reduces activity density while keeping flight, hotel, and confirmed meal IDs; "relaxed day plus six museums" explains the conflict and preserves the numeric requirement until the user decides. | FR-PREF-5/7, FR-ITIN-4 |
| T-E2E-07 | Scenario K: close/reopen the browser at a pending decision; the exact descriptor reloads from the server; resume completes the decision. | FR-GRAPH-2/3, FR-UI-4 |
| T-E2E-08 | Scenario L: controlled worker process restart at an interrupt and mid-operation; the inspector shows checkpoints, resume operations, and attempts; the trip continues without duplicate bookings. | FR-GRAPH-3/6, FR-UI-5 |
| T-E2E-09 | Injected errors D/E/F: provider failure keeps siblings and retries only the failed domain; invalid itinerary is repaired within 3 attempts; budget conflict offers alternatives without automatic downgrades; faults labelled `Simulated failure`. | FR-GRAPH-8, FR-ITIN-3/5, FR-DEMO-2 |
| T-E2E-10 | SSE disconnection/replay: disconnect mid-progress, reconnect with `after`/`Last-Event-ID`, missed events replay once (deduplicated); after HTTP `202` the UI shows queued/in-progress and never claims success until the persisted outcome arrives. | FR-UI-4 |
| T-E2E-11 | Keyboard-only completion of the core journey on desktop and mobile viewports: visible focus, accessible names, no pointer-only controls; English copy audit. | FR-PRD-1, FR-UI-2 |
| T-E2E-12 | Tiles unavailable (blocked/offline): schematic fallback renders markers and approximate labels; planning continues unaffected. | FR-UI-3, FR-DATA-8 |
| T-E2E-13 | Addendum rejection UX: PRG -> Ceske Budejovice explains `GROUND_TRAVEL_PREFERRED`, states the destination is not claimed unreachable by ground, offers origin/destination alternatives; no flight offers or booking can be produced. | FR-FEAS-3/6/10 |
| T-E2E-14 | Re-entrant modification after approval: new chat request after `END` enters a new run from `START`, preserves compatible selections, updates the summary; no `Command({update})` semantics observed. | FR-ITIN-5, FR-GRAPH-3/9, FR-UI-1/6 |

## 8. Invariant and Property Checks

| ID | Invariant (asserted over seeded matrices and after each relevant journey) | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T-INV-01 | Flights never contradict the selected Travel Variant (dates, windows, luggage-storage requirement for one-night). | FR-PREF-2, FR-DATA-4 |
| T-INV-02 | Hotel nights match travel dates; party totals agree across offers, bookings, and itinerary. | FR-PREF-2, FR-DATA-5 |
| T-INV-03 | Bookings reference valid snapshot offers; exactly one active reservation per service (also asserted at index level). | FR-BOOK-2 |
| T-INV-04 | Confirmed reservations are never silently replaced, superseded, or removed; only an explicit confirmed decision changes them. | FR-PREF-4, FR-BOOK-5 |
| T-INV-05 | Itinerary events never overlap impossibly; transfers, meal windows, and airport buffers hold. | FR-ITIN-2 |
| T-INV-06 | Synthetic locations stay inside reviewed envelopes/anchors; approximate labels present; landmarks carry reference provenance. | FR-DATA-6/7 |
| T-INV-07 | A change to one service cannot change unrelated selections, reservations, or scenario content hashes. | FR-GRAPH-9, FR-DATA-2 |
| T-INV-08 | Scenario data remain stable across restarts and retries and independent of fixture/live AI mode. | FR-DATA-1/2 |
| T-INV-09 | No real booking/payment path: dependency audit shows no payment or travel-provider SDK; runtime egress allowlist covers only configured LLM and optional tiles; no payment loop exists to trigger. | FR-PRD-4, FR-BOOK-7 |
| T-INV-10a | Fresh fingerprint at the generator: `generate_flights` rejects a stale/mismatched approval (PRG -> Rome approval after a change to Ceske Budejovice). | FR-FEAS-8 |
| T-INV-10b | Fresh fingerprint at booking: `commit_booking` re-verifies the current approval and current inputs; stale approval or changed route rejects the booking. | FR-FEAS-8 |
| T-INV-11 | `trip.revision` increments once per admitted business/decision request, monotonically; worker-derived writes and technical same-operation retry never increment it. | FR-GRAPH-4/5 |
| T-INV-12 | No LLM authority: model text, commands, or suggested IDs cannot mutate state, price, or book without deterministic validation and authorization. | FR-AI-3, FR-SEC-5 |

## 9. Feasibility Regression Suite (mandatory addendum, full list)

| ID | Regression | Level | FRs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-REG-FEAS-01 | PRG/Budejovice gets GROUND_TRAVEL_PREFERRED with a local airport and with all eligible destination candidates removed:reviewed-ground/245-minute lower bound precedes no-airport limitation. No downstream effects. | unit + integration gating | FR-FEAS-2/3 |
| T-REG-FEAS-02 | PRG -> Rome (and curated Paris/Barcelona) permitted by curated policy. | unit | FR-FEAS-4 |
| T-REG-FEAS-03 | Same airport / same catchment rejected. | unit | FR-FEAS-2 |
| T-REG-FEAS-03a | Cross-border same-catchment fixture (different country keys, same `metroCatchmentId`) rejected `SAME_CATCHMENT`. | unit | FR-FEAS-5 |
| T-REG-FEAS-04 | BCN -> PMI short island exception admitted through the explicit catalog (not rejected on distance alone); unknown island/mountain/fixed-link -> `UNDETERMINED`. | unit | FR-FEAS-4/6 |
| T-REG-FEAS-05 | Stage A `FEASIBLE` but Stage B leaves no valid combination -> `NO_VALID_OFFERS` with typed reasons; no research, booking, or itinerary begins; recovery decision offered (scenario B). | integration | FR-FEAS-6/9/10 |
| T-REG-FEAS-06 | Route requiring an impossible connection time rejected. | unit | FR-FEAS-9 |
| T-REG-FEAS-06a | StageA estimate<=600 but realized schedule>600 due to otherwise legal layover/leg variation:StageB returns DOOR_TO_DOOR_TOO_LONG, not selectable/bookable. | unit + integration | FR-FEAS-9 |
| T-REG-FEAS-07 | Flight arriving too late for the selected Travel Variant rejected. | unit | FR-FEAS-9 |
| T-REG-FEAS-08 | Return flight departing before the required sightseeing period ends rejected. | unit | FR-FEAS-9 |
| T-REG-FEAS-09 | Rejected route produces no simulated flight booking (no offer, selection, or reservation rows). | integration | FR-FEAS-10 |
| T-REG-FEAS-10 | Destination change triggers fresh Stage A. Sub-cases: 10a a change attempted during running work receives busy/stale conflict and no mutation; resubmission once waiting/idle succeeds and validates fresh. A test-only direct stale-input injection between Stage A and generation is blocked by the independent guard. 10b waiting at `flight_choice`, admitted modification resolves the old decision and fresh validation runs on resume. 10c after `END`, plain new command enters a new run and validates fresh. 10d repeats boundaries with a real worker restart after Rome approval; no restored unrelated `FEASIBLE` result is reused. | integration + fault | FR-FEAS-1/7 |
| T-REG-FEAS-11 | A previously rejected/undetermined route cannot bypass validation via AI commands, interrupt suspension, or resume. | integration | FR-FEAS-10, FR-AI-3 |
| T-REG-FEAS-12 | Failed feasibility does not continue into hotel booking or itinerary generation (no downstream artifacts/events). | integration | FR-FEAS-10 |

Fingerprint freshness at both guards is additionally covered by T-INV-10a/b; the change matrix also asserts no Ceske Budejovice offer or booking row exists anywhere after the change, with a worker process restart variant in 10d. Evidence for 10d includes the restored checkpoint ID and the mismatch rejection record.

## 10. Bounds and Lifecycle Checks

| Bound | Value | Enforcement point | Test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning attempts | 3 total per user operation | graph state + domain record | T-IT-LIM-01 |
| Research provider attempts | 2 total per affected domain per operation | failed-subset `Send` | T-IT-LIM-02 |
| LLM attempts | 2 total incl. 1 repair, adapter-owned | AI adapter | T-IT-LIM-03 |
| Driver automatic claims | 3 per explicitly authorized recovery round | worker driver; monotonic total counters | T-IT-LIM-04 |
| Recursion guard | `recursionLimit: 100` safety bound | invocation config | T-IT-LIM-01 |
| Worker concurrency | 2 trips; never concurrent invocations of one trip | advisory lock | T-IT-FLT-07 |

## 11. Fixture vs Live AI Modes

- Default gate: all unit/integration/E2E suites run with `AI_MODE=fixture`, without OpenRouter credentials; tests assert zero OpenRouter egress attempts and deterministic scripted responses.
- Live smoke is credential-gated and excluded from ordinary offline CI, but required to verify brief success criterion 28 for full product acceptance when credentials are configured. Exercise actual intent, planner/reviewer, configured role profiles, and observed usage/cost. Missing credentials leave this item explicitly unverified; they never count as a passed test.
- Unknown model pricing/capability rejects the first billable call (fail closed, T-UT-AI-02, T-IT-COST-02); startup syntax validation is local. Fixture/live labels are surfaced and cannot be mixed within one operation (T-IT-COST-03).

## 12. Concurrency (Scenarios M and N)

Both tests open two actual independent database connections (not two calls through the app's pooled client) to exercise real PostgreSQL locking: T-IT-CONC-01 (scenario M) submits the same confirmation concurrently and expects one reservation plus one stored result; T-IT-CONC-02 (scenario N) submits two conflicting modifications at the same revision and expects one deterministic winner, a typed conflict for the loser, and no mixed state. The same payload repeated on both connections must return the identical stored result.

## 13. Coverage Limitations and Non-goals

- No real provider or settlement contract tests: synthetic interfaces are verified against their contracts only; live-provider behavior is out of scope.
- Live LLM behavior requires the credential-gated smoke path in section 11; fixture tests prove orchestration, not model quality or success criterion 28. An unavailable live environment is an explicit unverified acceptance item.
- Tile availability is network-dependent; the tested guarantee is the offline fallback. Visual regression and performance/load testing beyond the demo-scale concurrency of section 12 are out of scope.
- Timezone correctness depends on the runtime ICU/tzdata version, which the suites record; tz-rule changes require rerun, not silent assumption.
- Import tests verify manifests, licenses, and transformation gates, not upstream data truth; curated landmarks are verified by reviewed source identity.
- Playwright requires browser binaries; the integration suite requires a running PostgreSQL 17 test instance. Both are documented prerequisites, not optional skips.
