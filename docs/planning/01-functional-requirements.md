# Functional Requirements and Traceability

Status: implementation specification, planning-only. No application code, tooling, or tests may be created while fulfilling this plan (`ODFT_BRIEF.md` final constraints). This document owns stable feature IDs (`FR-*`), scope boundaries, acceptance signals, and full traceability from `ODFT_BRIEF.md` sections, the 30 success criteria, the mandatory route-feasibility addendum, and scenarios A-N. Contracts and algorithms are owned by [architecture](02-architecture.md), [LangGraph design](03-langgraph-design.md), [domain model](04-domain-model.md), and [synthetic data design](05-synthetic-data-design.md); this file links to them instead of restating them. Test IDs are defined in the [testing strategy](11-testing-strategy.md); all of them are planned obligations, because no application or test code exists on 2026-10-10.

## 1. ID and Acceptance Conventions

- `FR-<AREA>-<n>` IDs are stable. Never renumber, reuse, or silently broaden an ID; new needs receive new IDs.
- `MUST` = required for POC acceptance. `POC-LIMIT` = deliberate, documented proof-of-concept boundary, not a defect.
- A requirement is accepted only through its named observable evidence: executed test IDs, or a stated deterministic artifact/command for review. Vague statements such as "the UI is good" are never acceptance.
- Executable commands are exactly the strict discriminated union in [domain model section 6](04-domain-model.md); this document never defines an alternate command contract. Decision responses are exactly [domain model section 7](04-domain-model.md).
- Phases are the refined P01-P12 sequence in section 7. Test prefixes: `T-UT-` unit, `T-IT-` real-PostgreSQL integration, `T-E2E-` Playwright, `T-INV-` invariant/property, `T-FLT-` crash/driver fault, `T-REG-FEAS-` feasibility regression suite (section 6 of the test strategy).

## 2. Actors and Scope

| Actor | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Traveler | Anonymous session; supplies welcome inputs, preferences, destination, selections, and decision responses; may send chat requests. |
| AI assistant | Interprets chat into validated commands, ranks existing candidates, drafts schedule/review/explanation text. Never mutates state, prices, or books. |
| Deterministic services | Admit commands, validate route/schedule/logistics/itinerary feasibility, price offers, authorize, commit reservations, project reads. |
| Worker | Sole graph writer/executor: claims durable operations, drives checkpoints, recovers crashes, emits execution events. |
| Demo operator | Explicitly enabled local/demo inspector: owned-trip simulation modes, fault injection, telemetry; controls disabled elsewhere. |

Scope: one English-language hybrid (wizard + chat) planner for one full sightseeing day in a European city with synthetic services and simulated bookings. Out of scope: registration/login, real providers, payments, multi-day sightseeing/multi-city planning, children/custom room allocation, localization, production-scale infrastructure.

## 3. Functional Requirements by Area

### 3.1 FR-PRD - Product, language, and demo honesty (brief section 1, section 2, section 8, section 21, section 23)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-PRD-1 | All UI text, prompts, messages, docs, and code identifiers are English; no localization feature. Acceptance: rendered views and build assets contain no non-English user-facing copy; review gate. | T-E2E-11, review | P01, P12 |
| FR-PRD-2 | Permanent visible disclaimer `DEMO APPLICATION - No real reservations are made and no payments are processed.`; every confirmation adds `Simulated booking - not valid for travel, accommodation, or restaurant admission.` | T-UT-PRD-01, T-E2E-03 | P06, P07 |
| FR-PRD-3 | Reservation references use `DEMO-FLT-`, `DEMO-HTL-`, or `DEMO-RST-` plus 20 uppercase random hex characters (80 bits), with SQL uniqueness and bounded collision retry. | T-UT-BOOK-01, T-IT-BOOK-01 | P03 |
| FR-PRD-4 | No commercial travel/payment integration: no payment fields, no provider SDK, no real booking endpoint. `POC-LIMIT`: real integration is intentionally absent. | T-INV-09, dependency review | P01, P12 |

### 3.2 FR-REF - Reference geography and licensing (brief section 3, section 4, section 7.2)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-REF-1 | Country then city selection from the admitted offline manifest, not a hardcoded three-city list; every city carries a coverage flag (`curated landmarks available` / `approximate generic program only` / `insufficient reference data`); omitted small towns are reported as dataset limitation. | T-UT-REF-01/02, T-E2E-02 | P02 |
| FR-REF-2 | European origin airports with offline autocomplete; any admitted origin selectable; PRG is only the prepared-demo default. | T-UT-REF-03, T-E2E-02 | P02, P06 |
| FR-REF-3 | Destination resolution considers multiple served airports and cross-border candidates (150 km radius, transfer <= 120 minutes), prefers reviewed metro catchments, and returns a structured limitation when no defensible airport exists. | T-UT-REF-04 | P02 |
| FR-REF-4 | Transcontinental/boundary policy is explicit: EU members plus GB/CH/NO/IS/LI/Balkan/MD/UA/BY/AD/MC/SM/VA/XK admitted; TR/RU only reviewed European-side allowlist entries; GE/AM/AZ/KZ and overseas territories excluded; island exceptions (Azores/Madeira/Canary) documented; XK marked as source/application extension. | T-UT-REF-01 | P02 |
| FR-REF-5 | Offline sources are used with recorded license/attribution/checksums: GeoNames CC BY, OurAirports public domain (voluntary credit), Wikidata CC0 source IDs, ODbL timezone-boundary asset distributed separately with attribution. No runtime geocoding. | T-UT-REF-05/06 | P02 |
| FR-REF-6 | Airports receive IANA zones only from import-time evidence (`geo-tz` + reviewed overrides); unknown/ambiguous zone results block passenger eligibility until reviewed. | T-UT-REF-06 | P02 |

### 3.3 FR-PREF - Preferences: variant, service level, pace (brief section 5, section 10)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-PREF-1 | Welcome collects name (1..60 chars), sightseeing date, origin airport, adults (default 1, 1..6), travel variant (default `two_nights`), default service level (default `standard`), activity pace (default `moderate`), optional total budget; values are persisted, validated, and round-trip through the read projection. | T-UT-PREF-01, T-E2E-01 | P06 |
| FR-PREF-2 | Variant date math: check-in `D-1`; checkout `D` (one night) or `D+1` (two nights); outbound arrival `D-1`; return departure late `D` or `D+1`; one-night variant is offered only when Stage B proves a feasible late return, and its later selected hotel must support luggage storage. | T-UT-PREF-03, T-IT-DATA-01 | P04, P06 |
| FR-PREF-3 | Inheritance: `effectiveServiceLevel = localOverride ?? defaultServiceLevel`; clearing an override removes it; explicit `standard` still counts as an override; changing the global default changes only inherited services; each meal has its own independent override. | T-UT-PREF-02, T-IT-REPL-01 | P06, P07 |
| FR-PREF-4 | A preference never replaces a confirmed selection: changing global or local level only refreshes recommendations and shows inherited vs explicit state; replacing a confirmed hotel/meal requires proposal plus explicit confirmation (matrix `X` in [LangGraph section 10](03-langgraph-design.md)). | T-IT-BOOK-06, T-E2E-04/05 | P07 |
| FR-PREF-5 | Activity Pace is independent of interest categories and includes the explicit distinction that a Relaxed pace can be museum-focused while an Intensive pace can be outdoor; guideline counts 2-3 / 3-5 / 5-7 activities are qualified by duration, travel, opening hours, meals, and required reservations. Pace changes preserve flights, hotel, and confirmed meal reservations. | T-UT-PREF-04, T-IT-REPL-01, T-E2E-06 | P04, P10 |
| FR-PREF-6 | Relative requests preserve the selected/confirmed offer's category: "find a cheaper hotel" uses the selected/confirmed party-total baseline and that offer's category even if the global effective preference later changed; only an explicit `find_alternatives.level` supplies a category change; without a selection the effective category is used plus a clarification or shown budget cap; preserved services stay untouched. | T-UT-PREF-05, T-E2E-04 | P08 |
| FR-PREF-7 | Numeric activity requests persist as typed absolute requirements in `minimumActivityCounts` via `set_activity_requirement` (clear with `null`); relative counts ("two more museums") are computed against current actual activity tags before storing; a pace/time conflict with a count is clarified or rejected, never silently dropped; contradictory requests produce an explanation with practical alternatives. | T-UT-PREF-04/06, T-E2E-06, scenario G | P08, P10 |

### 3.4 FR-FEAS - Mandatory route and schedule feasibility (brief addendum)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-FEAS-1 | Stage A route validation runs deterministically (never LLM-decided) before any flight generation and re-runs after every origin/city/date/variant/airport/reference/policy/transfer change; result is persisted as `FEASIBLE` / `INFEASIBLE` / `UNDETERMINED` with machine-readable reason codes, human explanation, and alternative actions. | T-UT-FEAS-01, T-REG-FEAS-10a-d | P04 |
| FR-FEAS-2 | Stage A rules are configurable, testable, and documented per [synthetic data section 5](05-synthetic-data-design.md): same-airport/catchment rejection, < 350 km short-route warning (never a sole rejection criterion), ground-preferred rule (ground <= 300 min and estimated air door-to-door >= ground + 45 min), standard direct eligibility 350..3500 km, at most one connection per direction at 75..240 minutes, 600-minute door-to-door cap. | T-UT-FEAS-01 | P04 |
| FR-FEAS-3 | PRG -> Ceske Budejovice is `INFEASIBLE: GROUND_TRAVEL_PREFERRED` using the reviewed road/rail corridor evidence; no flights are generated or bookable; the UI states the destination is not claimed unreachable by ground and offers origin/destination alternatives. | T-REG-FEAS-01, T-E2E-13 | P04, P06 |
| FR-FEAS-4 | Curated routes PRG -> Rome/Paris/Barcelona are permitted by the curated policy; the BCN -> PMI short-island exception is admitted through an explicit catalog entry (sea separation, no fixed link) and never rejected on distance alone; unknown island/mountain/fixed-link cases return `UNDETERMINED`. | T-REG-FEAS-02/04 | P04 |
| FR-FEAS-5 | Same-catchment rejection applies across borders: a reviewed cross-border catchment fixture (different country keys, same `metroCatchmentId`) is `INFEASIBLE: SAME_CATCHMENT`; country difference grants no exemption. | T-REG-FEAS-03a | P04 |
| FR-FEAS-6 | `UNDETERMINED` blocks generation under the conservative policy and produces a limitation decision with alternative actions; the system never invents flight offers to fill a wizard. | T-UT-FEAS-01, T-REG-FEAS-04, T-E2E-13 | P04, P06 |
| FR-FEAS-7 | The approval fingerprint binds origin airport, destination country/city, candidate airports/catchments, sightseeing date, variant, party size, transfer configuration, and reference/generator/policy versions ([domain model section 4](04-domain-model.md)); every change to a bound input forces fresh Stage A; restored checkpoints cannot reuse an unrelated `FEASIBLE` result. | T-UT-FEAS-02, T-REG-FEAS-10b-d | P04, P05 |
| FR-FEAS-8 | Both the synthetic flight generator and the booking service independently re-read the approval and compare its fingerprint with current domain inputs; stale, foreign, or mismatched approvals are rejected (no checkpoint-only approval). | T-INV-10a/b, T-REG-FEAS-09 | P04, P05 |
| FR-FEAS-9 | Independent StageB validates dates/late arrival/early return, connections, leg duration, realized door-to-door<=600 per direction, timezone/DST, buffers and full sightseeing. Only valid combinations are offered; typed failures lead to recovery, not fabricated repair. | T-UT-FEAS-03, T-REG-FEAS-05..08, T-REG-FEAS-06a | P04 |
| FR-FEAS-10 | Gating is absolute: a failed essential flight-feasibility requirement never proceeds to hotel research, booking simulation, or itinerary generation; rejected routes produce no offer, selection, or reservation; AI commands, chat, interrupt suspension, or resume cannot bypass validation. | T-REG-FEAS-09/11/12, scenario B | P04, P05 |

### 3.5 FR-DATA - Synthetic data, provenance, geographic safety (brief section 7)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-DATA-1 | Deterministic generation: `scenarioKey` hashes normalized inputs plus reference/generator/rule versions; independent per-domain seeds; identical inputs/versions produce identical content hashes; the persisted manifest records scenario ID, seed, generator/Faker version, generation date, destination, and domain hashes. | T-UT-DATA-01, T-IT-DATA-01 | P04 |
| FR-DATA-2 | Preference changes filter/rank existing inventory; a genuine extension appends an immutable snapshot version, preserves prior offer IDs and content hashes, and cannot alter unrelated domains (hotel regeneration never changes flights). | T-UT-DATA-01, T-IT-DATA-01 | P04 |
| FR-DATA-3 | Faker is limited to fictional labels and controlled variation; domain algorithms own schedules, prices, coordinates, dates, and capacity; parallel domains use separate PRNG instances, never a reseeded global singleton. | T-UT-DATA-02 | P04 |
| FR-DATA-4 | Flight realism: real airport identity/codes, distance-based durations (`ceil(25 + km/700*60)`, >= 35 min), at most one stop, 75..240-minute connections, UTC instants plus IANA display zones, overnight transitions and DST gap/fold handled, no claim of real timetables. | T-UT-FEAS-03, T-REG-FEAS-06..08 | P04 |
| FR-DATA-5 | Pricing: simulated EUR minor units, party totals, hotel by level/city/season/weekend/nights, restaurant by meal/level/cuisine, flights by distance/season; meaningful Budget < Standard < Luxury separation; no unrelated random per-offer values. | T-UT-DATA-02 | P04 |
| FR-DATA-6 | Geographic safety: hotels/restaurants use reviewed anchors or bounded safe templates inside the city envelope; rejected positions fail generation; pins and transfers are labelled approximate with no navigation claim; curated cities use verified real landmarks with source IDs while non-curated cities offer only explicitly synthetic generic activities. | T-UT-DATA-03, T-E2E-12 | P02, P04 |
| FR-DATA-7 | Provenance is explicit everywhere: `Geographic reference`, `Demo offer`, `Simulated schedule/price`, `Approximate location`, `AI recommendation`; fictional businesses/airlines are visibly demo data; real landmark identities keep their attribution. | T-UT-DATA-03, T-E2E-03 | P04, P06 |
| FR-DATA-8 | Routing estimates are deterministic and simulated (walk/public transport/taxi/airport transfer with uncertainty); straight-line distance is never presented as road distance; the offline map fallback renders markers/schematic links only. | T-UT-RTE-01, T-E2E-12 | P04, P07 |

### 3.6 FR-BOOK - Simulated bookings (brief section 8)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-BOOK-1 | Flow search -> select -> review -> explicit confirm -> deterministic demo reservation -> persist -> confirmation; reservations are created only by the deterministic booking service, never by LLM output. | T-E2E-01/03, T-IT-BOOK-05 | P03, P07 |
| FR-BOOK-2 | Exactly one active (`confirmed`) reservation per trip and service, enforced by a partial unique index; replacement supersedes the old row and confirms the new one in a single transaction; the old reservation remains active until the replacement is confirmed; history is never cascade-deleted. | T-IT-BOOK-01/06, scenario M | P03 |
| FR-BOOK-3 | Idempotency: duplicate submission with the same request key returns the stored result (one reservation); reuse of a key with a different payload is rejected; a new key for the same offer returns the existing active reservation; node replay, interrupt resume, and concurrent browser requests cannot double-book. | T-IT-BOOK-02/03, T-IT-CONC-01 | P03 |
| FR-BOOK-4 | Wrong input cannot book: foreign offer ID (outside allowed IDs/snapshot), foreign trip, stale source fingerprint, wrong or resolved decision, foreign thread, or stale revision all fail with typed conflicts and create no reservation row. | T-IT-BOOK-04 | P03 |
| FR-BOOK-5 | Lifecycle states `proposed`/`confirmed`/`superseded`/`cancelled`; changing a service never silently invalidates a confirmed selection; route changes require an explicit impact preview and confirmation transaction. | T-IT-BOOK-06, T-REG-FEAS-10a | P03, P11 |
| FR-BOOK-6 | Confirmation is a decision response (`confirm_booking`, `acceptedDemoDisclaimer: true`); a model text saying "confirmed" has no authority; confirmation and itinerary approval are not LLM-executable commands. | T-UT-AI-01, T-IT-AI-01 | P03, P08 |
| FR-BOOK-7 | No real reservations or payments: zero fees, internal demo records only, no payment library or travel API anywhere. `POC-LIMIT`: integration with real providers is explicitly excluded. | T-INV-09 | P03, P12 |
| FR-BOOK-8 | Optional restaurant reservations use the same proposal/confirmation flow; no booking is hidden inside itinerary generation or recommendation refresh. | T-E2E-01, T-IT-REPL-01 | P07 |
| FR-BOOK-9 | Flight/hotel bookings are optional (`decline_booking`, "I don't want to book"): declining keeps the chosen offer as the step's selection without creating a reservation; the plan, its costs, the airport buffer, and the hotel anchor are computed as if the service existed, every overview marks it `Not booked`, and a later booking uses the same proposal/confirmation flow. A confirmed service cannot be declined. | T-E2E-15, T-IT-BOOK-07 | P07, P12 |

### 3.7 FR-ITIN - Itinerary planning, validation, review (brief section 6 steps 7-8, section 9.3, section 9.4, section 11.5)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-ITIN-1 | A complete sightseeing day contains breakfast, morning activities, lunch, afternoon activities, breaks, dinner when feasible, transfers, durations, and costs, respecting variant and return-flight windows; deterministic code resolves costs/routes/fixed reservation times; the planner selects only existing candidate IDs. | T-E2E-01, T-IT-REPL-01 | P10 |
| FR-ITIN-2 | The deterministic validator detects time conflicts, impossible transfers, excessive travel/walking, insufficient breaks, opening-hour mismatches, budget violations, flight conflicts, unmet `minimumActivityCounts`, and preference conflicts with machine-readable errors/warnings/metrics; errors block approval, warnings require visible explanation. | T-UT-ITIN-01, T-E2E-09 | P10 |
| FR-ITIN-3 | Planning is bounded: at most 3 total plan attempts per user operation for the plan -> validate -> review -> replan loop; after exhaustion a recovery/clarification decision presents the best valid partial information; no infinite loops. | T-IT-LIM-01, scenario E | P10 |
| FR-ITIN-4 | The review agent detects qualitative problems (poor sequencing, unnecessary travel, density, preference mismatch) and may propose safe revisions, but never overrules deterministic rejection and never edits confirmed reservations to make a plan pass. | T-UT-ITIN-02, T-E2E-09 | P10 |
| FR-ITIN-5 | Itinerary versions are immutable and append-only with approval state; the approved itinerary remains editable through the assistant after completion; budget conflicts stop the loop and offer lower-cost alternatives or budget clarification without automatic downgrades. | T-E2E-09/14 | P10, P11 |

### 3.8 FR-GRAPH - Durable LangGraph orchestration (brief section 11, section 12)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-GRAPH-1 | LangGraph Graph API (TypeScript) is essential, not a wrapper: persistent PostgreSQL checkpoints, parallel research, conditional routing, bounded loops, interrupts, resume, restart recovery, selective replanning, and observable execution. | T-IT-INV-01..07, T-E2E-08 | P05 |
| FR-GRAPH-2 | Exactly one generic pure `await_decision` interrupt with strict `DecisionKind` (flight/hotel/program/booking/replacement/route-change/itinerary/clarification/recovery); one pending decision per trip; no side effects, budget charges, or counters before the interrupt; no interrupts inside parallel research. | T-IT-INV-03/06, T-E2E-07 | P05 |
| FR-GRAPH-3 | Exact invocation contract ([LangGraph section 8](03-langgraph-design.md)): new thread = plain validated input; new request after `END` = plain new-operation input restarting at `START` with persisted state (never `Command({update})`); exact pending decision = `Command({resume})`; crashed invocation with unfinished tasks and no unanswered interrupt = `null`; `null` on a completed thread is a no-op; resume without a matching interrupt = stale conflict without invocation. `durability: "sync"` and `recursionLimit: 100` are set. | T-IT-INV-01..07 | P05 |
| FR-GRAPH-4 | One writer per trip: only the worker invokes graphs; a session advisory lock plus lease/fencing token guards execution; BFF handlers never invoke threads; `trip.revision` increments exactly once per admitted user request; worker writes require the operation ID and matching fingerprints. | T-IT-FLT-07, T-IT-CONC-02 | P05 |
| FR-GRAPH-5 | Command admission: dedupe on `(trip_id, request_id)`, `expectedRevision` check, immutable accepted payload, `409 OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS` while a conflicting operation is queued/running, one queued/running operation per trip, deterministic single winner for simultaneous same-revision commands. | T-IT-CONC-02 | P05 |
| FR-GRAPH-6 | Crash reconciliation uses idempotent effect keys `(operation_id, node_name, effect_scope)`: domain commit before a failed checkpoint replays to the stored result; a checkpoint without its completion event repairs the projection without booking again; database/checkpoint failures fail the operation safely (no fabricated success) with bounded backoff and 3 automatic driver claims before explicit retry. | T-IT-FLT-01..04, T-IT-FLT-05/06 | P04, P05 |
| FR-GRAPH-7 | Parallel research uses `Send` fan-out for affected domains, one static edge into `join_research`, and a reducer map keyed `researchRunId:domain`; equal keys merge only with identical idempotent results, conflicting same-key results are rejected, and zero affected domains route directly to the next serial node (no dangling fan-in). | T-IT-RED-01/02 | P09 |
| FR-GRAPH-8 | Provider failure isolation: known failures are tagged domain results; successful siblings are retained; retries send only failed domains with total provider attempts <= 2 per operation; unexpected sibling exceptions leave completed pending writes in place and `null` recovery reruns only unfinished tasks. | T-IT-RET-01/02, scenario D | P09 |
| FR-GRAPH-9 | Selective invalidation follows [LangGraph section 10](03-langgraph-design.md): a change to one service preserves unrelated selections, reservations, and scenario content hashes; a dinner-only override reruns neither breakfast nor lunch; pace changes keep flights, hotel, and confirmed meals fixed; route changes invalidate both feasibility stages and require explicit confirmation for incompatible bookings. | T-IT-REPL-01, T-INV-07, T-E2E-04/05/06 | P11 |
| FR-GRAPH-10 | State ownership: checkpoints own graph position, pending refs, and bounded counters; PostgreSQL domain rows own preferences, selections, reservations, and artifacts; checkpoints contain no datasets, secrets, prompts, or reasoning; new runs after `END` reset per-operation counters and work scope via a serial-node `Overwrite`, never from parallel workers. | T-IT-INV-02, T-IT-DATA-01 | P09, P11 |

### 3.9 FR-AI - AI roles, commands, cost control (brief section 9, section 10, section 15)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-AI-1 | Four specialized AI roles (intent, recommendation, planner, reviewer) behind a provider-independent adapter with OpenRouter as the initial provider; every role has a configurable model profile (model ID, provider, supported reasoning/temperature, timeout, token caps, retry limit, cost budget). Responses use outcome templates plus validated role explanations, not an extra LLM call; no single hardcoded model. | T-UT-AI-02, T-IT-AI-01 | P08 |
| FR-AI-2 | AI output is strict Zod-validated structured data: commands come only from [domain model section 6](04-domain-model.md), intents are validated discriminated unions, at most four compatible commands per request, unknown keys and arbitrary operations rejected; the intent `preserve` union covers bookings plus activities/events and conflicting commands are rejected; one repair attempt maximum. | T-UT-AI-01, T-IT-AI-01 | P08 |
| FR-AI-3 | AI never mutates state, executes bookings, or bypasses authorization; the pipeline is user request -> interpretation -> schema validation -> deterministic execution -> validation -> response; untrusted content (chat text, persisted messages) cannot become executable operations (prompt-injection protection). | T-IT-AI-01, T-INV-12 | P08 |
| FR-AI-4 | Cost control: default limits 40 attempted billable calls and USD 1.00 per trip; worst-case cost is reserved before each call; calls, attempts, tokens, latency, and estimated/actual cost are ledgered; unknown model pricing or capability is rejected before the call (fail closed). | T-UT-AI-02, T-IT-COST-01..03 | P08 |
| FR-AI-5 | Fixture mode is the default (`AI_MODE=fixture`) and works fully without OpenRouter credentials via scripted responses and deterministic fixtures; live OpenRouter mode requires explicit validated configuration; fixture and live operation are always clearly labelled and never mixed silently. | T-IT-COST-03, T-E2E-01 | P08 |
| FR-AI-6 | Conversation context uses a compact structured summary plus current state; authoritative preferences live in domain records, not conversation memory; the full transcript is not resent per request. | T-IT-AI-01 | P08 |
| FR-AI-7 | Ambiguous or contradictory requests ask for clarification with bounded options; safe obvious interpretations proceed without unnecessary questions; clarifications bind to schema-validated option IDs. | T-E2E-06, scenario G | P08 |

### 3.10 FR-UI - Hybrid user experience and inspector (brief section 6, section 13, section 14)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-UI-1 | Hybrid interface: wizard steps 0-10 (welcome, country, city, flights, hotel, restaurants, attractions/entertainment, itinerary, review, modifications, summary) plus a persistent assistant panel available throughout; UI controls and chat use the same validated command dispatcher. | T-E2E-01/02, T-E2E-14 | P06, P07 |
| FR-UI-2 | Responsive desktop and mobile layouts with keyboard-operable controls, visible focus, and accessible names; no chain-of-thought or fabricated internal reasoning is displayed. | T-E2E-11 | P07, P12 |
| FR-UI-3 | Lightweight client-only map, compliant optional tiles/attribution, offline schematic fallback; never a broken blank view. | T-E2E-12 | P10, P12 |
| FR-UI-4 | Progress is streamed via same-origin SSE with persisted monotonic events, replay (`after`/`Last-Event-ID`), deduplication, and heartbeat; polling is the fallback; an HTTP `202` means queued, so the UI must not claim success until the persisted outcome arrives. | T-E2E-10, T-IT-OPS-01 | P05, P11 |
| FR-UI-5 | Execution inspector shows nodes (active/completed/pending/interrupted/failed), retry attempts, checkpoints, resumes, durations, LLM calls/tokens/estimated cost, scenario mode, and injected failures; simulated faults are always labelled. | T-E2E-08, T-E2E-09 | P11 |
| FR-UI-6 | Final summary shows name, destination, dates, flights, hotel, restaurants, attractions, chronological timeline, map, estimated total cost, reservation references, and trip notes; it stays editable via the assistant after approval. | T-E2E-01, T-E2E-14 | P07, P11 |

### 3.11 FR-SEC - Sessions, ownership, protected resume (brief section 16)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-SEC-1 | Anonymous session with CSPRNG token, HttpOnly + SameSite cookie, CSRF token, and 30-day inactivity expiry; no registration/login. | T-IT-OPS-01 | P05 |
| FR-SEC-2 | Every read/write checks trip ownership from the session; entity IDs alone never authorize. | T-IT-BOOK-04 | P05 |
| FR-SEC-3 | Write endpoints validate Zod bodies, rate limits, origin/CSRF, body size; secrets stay server-side and never appear in client bundles. | T-UT-OPS-01 | P05 |
| FR-SEC-4 | Resume protection uses owner session + CSRF + unguessable decision UUID + `expectedRevision` + exact pending-interrupt/fingerprint binding; no additional browser bearer decision token is introduced ([domain model section 7](04-domain-model.md)). | T-IT-INV-06, T-IT-BOOK-04 | P05 |
| FR-SEC-5 | AI input is untrusted: model output cannot bypass deterministic validation or authorization; demo inspector commands are protected and unavailable outside the local demo deployment. | T-IT-AI-01, scenario controls | P08, P12 |

### 3.12 FR-DEMO - Scenarios A-N and failure injection (brief section 14)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-DEMO-1 | Scenarios A-G are persisted deterministic behavior modes (normal, no flights, hotels unavailable, provider failure, invalid itinerary, budget conflict, preference conflict) activatable from the inspector; H-N are deterministic action recipes/tests (hotel change, override, pace change, interruption, restart, duplicate booking, concurrent modifications); each has a deterministic assertion (see section 6). | T-E2E-07..09, T-IT-CONC-01/02, suite in section 6 | P09-P12 |
| FR-DEMO-2 | Failure injection alters provider/validator behavior through persisted overlays without regenerating unrelated scenario data; injection counters and labels survive retries and restarts; every injected fault shows `Simulated failure`. | T-IT-RET-01, T-IT-DATA-01 | P09 |
| FR-DEMO-3 | Scenario controls are typed protected commands allowed only from the local/demo inspector; a browser can never execute server shell commands; restart recipes are operator instructions with observed evidence. | Review, T-E2E-08 | P11 |

### 3.13 FR-OPS - Roadmap, local operation, verification (brief section 17, section 18, section 19, section 23)

| ID | Requirement and acceptance signal | Tests | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FR-OPS-1 | Implementation follows the refined P01-P12 sequence in section 7; each phase is independently executable, starts with analysis, ends with acceptance checks, and stops; no architectural decision is delegated to the implementation model; package/version substitutions require an explicit report, never a silent swap. | Phase gates in section 7 | All |
| FR-OPS-2 | Documented local start: `npm ci`, `docker compose up -d postgres`, `npm run db:migrate`, `npm run checkpointer:setup`, `npm run dev`, plus `.env.example` with placeholders only. | T-IT-OPS-01 | P01, P12 |
| FR-OPS-3 | Automated gates: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run build`; integration/E2E use a disposable PostgreSQL 17 test database, never production data. | Test strategy section 3 | P01-P12 |
| FR-OPS-4 | Final deliverables per brief section 23 (architecture summary, stack, diagrams, node inventory, data summary, AI responsibilities, interaction model, preference/pace rules, invalidation matrix, booking lifecycle, phase list, five risks, assumptions, exact Phase 01 instructions) exist in `docs/planning/` and the phase files before implementation starts. | Docs review | P01 |

## 8. POC Constraints and Coverage Limitations

- `POC-LIMIT`: no real availability, timetables, provider integration, payments, login, or worldwide travel; synthetic schedules/prices are never claimed as real.
- Fixture AI is the default and complete without credentials. Live OpenRouter behavior remains a mandatory product capability; its smoke test is excluded from ordinary offline CI but required to verify success criterion 28 when credentials are configured. Missing credentials are an explicit unverified acceptance item, not a passed test.
- `POC-LIMIT`: city coverage follows GeoNames `cities15000`; small towns may be absent and are reported as a dataset limitation, never invented.
- `POC-LIMIT`: TR/RU support is a reviewed allowlist; Asian-side airports such as SAW are excluded by geographic policy, not labeled invalid.
- `POC-LIMIT`: map tiles are optional; the offline schematic fallback is the tested guarantee. Route times are approximate estimates, never navigation.
- `POC-LIMIT`: EUR only, adults only (1..6), no children/rooms customization, no multi-city or multi-day trips.
- `POC-LIMIT`: timezone correctness depends on the runtime ICU/tzdata version, which is recorded; political rule changes need a runtime update plus regression tests.
- `POC-LIMIT`: concurrency guarantees are demo-scale (two connections, one winner); no production load claim.
- Long-term reproducibility relies on persisted scenario snapshots, not seeds alone; `generatedAt` is excluded from determinism payload comparisons.
- No unresolved architectural decision is delegated to the implementation model. Remaining inputs are operational: credentials/model IDs, import timestamps/checksums, ports/secrets, lockfile patch resolution.
